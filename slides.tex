2) Overview: two claims:
    First: RL is a good framework for characterizing rationality under realistic assumptions
    
    Second: As a result, we find that the concepts used to model the world dictate rationality (forest images)
    
3) Rationality
    > Logic, probabilistic coherence, bounded rationality
    > 
    
4) Reinforcement Learning
    > Overview (same slides as always, pretty much)
    
5) RL for rationality
    > Agents need to solve these problems
    
    
6) Concepts dictate rationality
    > State concepts
    > Action concepts
    > planning difficulty, learning difficulty
    
7) People do this, too!


8) Conclusions
